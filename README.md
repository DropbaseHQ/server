# Dropbase Server

This repository contains the server codebase for [Dropbase](https://github.com/DropbaseHQ/dropbase). It contains the following services:

- `Server` - processes client requests and spins up a task worker to run Dropbase Functions. The server also updates page properties via context.
- `LSP Server` - enables auto-complete and auto-saving of Python code in Studio
- `Worker` - runs Dropbase Functions with the user inputs passed through via the client. Itâ€™s built as an async task runner.
- `Dropbase Package` - contains system-wide schemas, models and utility functions

## Prerequisites

- Python > 3.11
- [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
https://github.com/DropbaseHQ/server.git
cd server
```

### Add server.toml and worker.toml files

In Dropbase root directory, create `server.toml` and `worker.toml` files:

`server.toml` contains environmental variables for the server

```bash
host_path = "" # absolute path to server directory w/o trailing slash e.g. "/Users/ayazhan/dropbase/server"
openai_api_key = "" # required to use Dropbase AI features
```

`worker.toml` contains environmental variables for the worker. This includes database sources, API keys, or access token to third party services.

```bash
[database.sqlite.demo]
host = "files/demo.db"
```

A `demo` sqlite database is included in the files directory, so you can use it out of the the box.
To add other types of databases, refer to the [data source docs](https://dropbase.notion.site/Dropbase-Docs-33de11a56f1248809d0911e06260f585#982ea4e99edc4f718543cc9e0e8e011f)

### Create Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment for the project:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

NOTE: Use the same `.venv` virtual environment to run the server, worker, and LSP.

### Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-worker.txt
pip install -r requirements-lsp.txt
```

### Make run.sh Executable

Make the `run.sh` script executable:

```sh
chmod +x run.sh
```

### Run the Server

Run the server:

```sh
./run.sh s
```

### Run the LSP Server

In a separate terminal, run the LSP server:

```sh
./run.sh l
```

### Run the Redis Server

In a separate terminal, run the Redis server:

```sh
redis-server
```
